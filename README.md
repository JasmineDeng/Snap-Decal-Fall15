#Snap! Below the line - Fall 2015 - Final Project

##Debug Block

Our main idea for the final project came from an actual feature request for the Snap! language: add a **Debug Block**.

We will build a block that pauses the execution and gives control the execution flow to the user, allowing features like variable checking and understanding what the code is doing.

This will help students to understand (and fix, if needed) their code with ease.
